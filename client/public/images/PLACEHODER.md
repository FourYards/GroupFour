This just makes the folder appear in Git. Delete this file when we have actual images

Use this folder for images that need to be accessible outside vue and for jpgs, pngs, etc.
Also use this folder for images that should be accessible outside of the context of a specific component.

If an image is specific to a component or a set of components only, place those images in the assets directory.
If an image should always be available at a specific absolute path, place the images here.
