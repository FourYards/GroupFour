## Meeting Notes

Looks like everything is going well. We're all pretty well up to speed on things.

- Kyler Added the linting and formatting tooling and setup integrations for this
- Components are coming along well. Responded to questions Wesley had on best practice for code reuse in these.
- Models for login are now created. DB REPL is also live. Richard will continue to define models for the rest of the app going forward.
- Route endpoint structure looks great. Responded to Keaton's question on how we will be pulling in relations.
- Need to add a note on what is needed for node-gyp so that sqlite installs fine on all platforms. Will add this to the readme
