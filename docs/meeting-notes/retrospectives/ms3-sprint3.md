# Milestone 3 Sprint 3 Retrospective

## What went well

We were able to successfully finish the DB models/table structures and migrations after a lot of setbacks with this. Frontend is really starting to come together after setbacks. Login system is up and running. We had a productive last few days pumping out some of the frontend pages to get things moving along further. Unit tests made at this time were build without additional direction to focus on this, which is helping us keep them up to date as wel go.

## Not so well

We have a lot of our pieces in a good place, but things aren't as well-integrated at this point as we would really like. Tests have also fallen a bit behind, though Keaton seems to have a very strong grasp on the testing framework at this point.

## Specific Improvements

Focus on moving everyone to a more full-stack mindset since the app is already pretty well scaffolded by now and everyone has done some work on most elements of the app as of now. Increase unit test coverage simultaneously with backend build-out. We will have a lot of functional testing that needs to be done at this point also.

## Workload Percentage

Wes really pulled through a lot on the main components, providing templates for new pages that will still need to be built. Massive time-saver on his part for the rest of us.

- Kyler: 24%
- Wes: 28%
- Keaton: 24%
- Richard: 24%
