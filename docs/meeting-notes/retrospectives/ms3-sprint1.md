# Milestone 3 Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What went well

Application framework/scaffolding is now here and all up and running! People are starting to settle into their tooling stacks and we all have running environments. Foundation is layed and we have a strong idea of how the backend and data infrastructure will shape up.

## Not so well

We'll have to move back from Vue 3 to Vue 2. This will take some retooling and will be a bit of a setback for the frontend. This is due to many component libraries still not supporting Vue 3 even though the Vue project is already heavily pushing people towards v3 by now for new projects.

## Specific Improvements

Should have researched our component libraries earlier on.

## Workload Percentage

Pretty even split from what we can tell, so we'll just approximate the 25%. Everyone has been keeing a good solid pace on assigned tasks.

- Kyler: 25%
- Wes: 25%
- Keaton: 25%
- Richard: 25%
