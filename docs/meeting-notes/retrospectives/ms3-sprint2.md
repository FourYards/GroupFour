# Milestone 3 Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What went well

Some fantastic work was done on the backend. Frontend framework is starting to come together. The Vue 3 -> 2 migration is finished. DB Models are generally defined and nearly ready for use, despite some setbacks. Data formats are well defined, so we can easily stub out data on the front end if needed. Backend already has some tests ready for it as well.

## Not so well

Hit some snags on getting the DB ready as well as snags with Vue. Slowed us down and likely had to do with the fact that we're a bit rusty on some of those things. Additionally, migrations were giving us some grief with the DB.

## Specific Improvements

Figure out a way to streamline migrations. Get the base components that will be reused built out on the front end. Establish file conventions to work within our tooling more effectively

## Workload Percentage

Pretty even split from what we can tell, so we'll just approximate the 25%. Everyone has been keeing a good solid pace on assigned tasks.

- Kyler: 25%
- Wes: 25%
- Keaton: 25%
- Richard: 25%
