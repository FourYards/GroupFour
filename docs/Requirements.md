# Requirements Definition

## Intro and Context (Req. Defs)

Throughout the year, homeowners have lots of work to get done on their property that they may not want to do themselves. To help fix this problem, this project aims to build a system to allow users to list and accept yard work jobs.

The system will allow customers to post job listings for a variety of common yard tasks (lawn mowing, snow shoveling, leaf raking, possibly more). Customers will be able to see and choose which offering providers they choose to give the job to. Customers will be able to set a preferred time for the job to be completed. The customer will be asked to verify that the job is done when the system thinks it is, and review the provider that performed the requested task. The charge for each job will be taken out of the customer&#39;s account upon completion of each job. The system will provide a way for customers to see and manage their active job listings.

The system will allow providers to browse local job listings, and bid against other providers on each job. The provider will be able to tell the system that an accepted job is completed, and their account will be paid once the customer verifies the job&#39;s completion. The system will provide a way for providers to see, and manage their accepted, and tentative jobs.

This system will provide a great platform for yard work customers and providers to interact with each other and get what both parties need.
